Tools for making extraction of Census Bureau data easier.

For example, to get income values by census tract which were estimated from the
Amercian Community Survey (ACS):

>>> import numpy
>>> import pyACS
>>> table = pyACS.ACS(pyACS.sumlevel.TRACT)
>>> len(table)
74002
>>> c = table['B19013001'] # Median Household Income
>>> c = numpy.nan_to_num(c)
>>> round(c.mean())
54404.0
>>> numpy.median(c)
49028.0

But first you need to download and install the census data....

$ mkdir /pyacs
$ cd /pyacs
$ wget "http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/2007-2011_ACSSF_All_In_2_Giant_Files(Experienced-Users-Only)/Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.tar.gz"
$ tar xfz Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.tar.gz
$ mv group2 SUMFILE

The downloaded file of attribute data is ~3gb "Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.zip" containsestimates for block groups and tracts only.

Now get the GEO files...
$ wget "http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/2007-2011_ACSSF_All_In_2_Giant_Files(Experienced-Users-Only)/2011_ACS_Geography_Files.zip"
$ unzip 2011_ACS_Geography_Files.zip
$ mv geog GEO

The downloaded GEO files contain the link between the `Logical Record Number` of the attribute data and the `geoid` of the shapefile/geometry data

### Description of the files in `$ ls /pyacs`:
  
  * `column_lookup.csv` contains {variable code : variable name}
  
`/SUMFILE` contains files formatted as data tables, where
	* each row holds the attribute values for one geographic area
  	* `Logical Record Number` column denotes the ID of the geographic area
        * columns after the `Logical Record Number` are values for the census variables
	* the files are organized into sets of state files
	* there are two types of sets of state files: variable estimates and errors (`e<2011XXXX>.txt` files contain estimates)
	* Naming schema: <estimate><year><periodicity><state><sequence#><iterationID>.txt
  	* iterationID is usually `000`
  	* each state datset has been sequenced into 113 chunks of text files
  	* `m2011<stXXXX>.csv` files are error margins associated to estimates

`/GEO` contains files where 
	* the `Logical Record Number` of an area is on the same row as the shapefile's FIPS code (geoid) 
	* areas are organized by states files, ie. `g20115ak.csv`, etc...
