Tools for making extraction of Census Bureau data easier.

For example, to get income values by census tract which were estimated from the
Amercian Community Survey (ACS):


>>> import numpy
>>> import pyACS
>>> table = pyACS.ACS(pyACS.sumlevel.TRACT)
>>> len(table)
74002
>>> c = table['B19013001'] # Median Household Income
>>> c = numpy.nan_to_num(c)
>>> round(c.mean())
54404.0
>>> numpy.median(c)
49028.0





But first you need to download and install the census data....
$ mkdir /pyacs
$ cd /pyacs
$ wget "http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/2007-2011_ACSSF_All_In_2_Giant_Files(Experienced-Users-Only)/Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.tar.gz"
$ tar xfz Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.tar.gz
$ mv group2 SUMFILE

The downloaded file of attribute data is ~3gb "Tracts_Block_Groups_Only.zip" containsestimates for block groups and tracts only.

Now get the GEO files...
$ wget "http://www2.census.gov/acs2011_5yr/summaryfile/2007-2011_ACSSF_All_In_2_Giant_Files(Experienced-Users-Only)/2011_ACS_Geography_Files.zip"
$ unzip 2011_ACS_Geography_Files.zip
$ mv geog GEO

The downloaded GEO files contain the link between the `Logical Record Number` of the attribute data and the `geoid` of the shapefile/geometry data

### Description of the files in `$ ls /pyacs`:
  
  * `column_lookup.csv` contains {variable code : variable name}
  * `table_restrictions.csv` is not relevant, its has information on specific nestings of geographies
`/SUMFILE` contains 
	* rows of  attribute values for each geographic area
  	* `Logical Record Number` column denotes the ID of the geographic area
        * columns after the  `Logical Record Number` are values for the census variables
	* The files are organized into sets of state files
	* Each set of state files has variable estimates and errors that are sequenced into 113 chunks of text files
  	* e<2011XXXX>.txt files contain estimates (relevant).
  	* Naming schema: <estimate><year><periodicity><state><sequence#><iterationID>.txt
  	* iterationID is usually 000
  	* m2011<stXXXX>.csv files of error margins are associated to estimates (for now not relevant).
        * each state has the same set of sequence id files mapped to same col variables
`/GEO` contains
	* mapping { `Logical Record Number` attribute value : shapefile geometry FIPS code } 
	* per state ie. g20115ak.csv, etc...
